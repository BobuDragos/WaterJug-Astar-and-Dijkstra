# Water Jug Problem Solution using A* Algorithm with Dijkstra's Heuristic

This is a Python implementation of the classic Water Jug Problem using A* algorithm with Dijkstra's heuristic.

The Water Jug Problem is a classic problem in AI, where the objective is to determine how to measure out a specific quantity of water with two jugs of different sizes. In this implementation, we use A* algorithm with Dijkstra's heuristic to find the shortest possible path to measure out a specific quantity of water.

## Requirements
